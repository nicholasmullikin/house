<p>Processing and HTML</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Processing and HTML are very different languages. HTML is  used to code websites and work with other programming languages. Processing is  a version of Java that is primarily used to make visual programs. Processing  looks more similar to English than HTML because it has more alphabetical  commands instead of symbols.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Processing and Microsoft Paint</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft Paint only has a GUI that the user controls, while  in Processing, the user needs to type in commands that can draw shapes and  colors that are able to change over time. Microsoft Paint only changes a  picture once it is saved. Processing constantly updates the window, changing according to the code that has been typed in.</p>

<p>English instructions and Processing</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Processing is designed to be human friendly, but is more structured because certain words correspond to specific computer commands. English can be ambiguous as even a single sentence can entail many instructions that are already understood by the recipient of the instructions. Processing has commands that tell the computer to do exactly as is written. Processing can also be more efficient especially when doing repeated mathematical or logical computations.</p>
